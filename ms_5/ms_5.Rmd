My final project will focus on finding regional patterns in the ratings of Slovak primary and secondary schools, mainly the dependence of schools' performances on the socioeconomic situation of their counties. The plot below is the first attempt at viewing these relationships, as it looks at the overall rating of primary schools in all counties (provided by INEKO, a Slovak NGO) versus the average monthly salary in these counties (collected by the Slovak government).

You can find my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/matejcerman/gov1005_final_project).
